Configuration settings for Vim (and hence !MacVim) are set in the files "~/.vimrc" and "~/.gvimrc" (see ":h vimrc-intro").  If these files don't already exist you simply have to create them (and make sure to save them in your home directory, i.e. "~/").

=== How to change the default size of new windows ===

Add "set lines=35" and/or "set columns=100" to your "~/.gvimrc" file and new windows will be 35 lines high and 100 columns wide (see ":h 'lines'", ":h 'columns'").

=== Monaco 10pt is jagged even though 'antialias' is set ===

Open up Terminal and type
{{{
defaults write org.vim.MacVim AppleSmoothFixedFontsSizeThreshold 1
}}}
and restart !MacVim.


=== How to make open and save dialogs show hidden files ===

_!MacVim 7.2 stable 1 and Snapshot 33 (or later) have a checkbox to show hidden files in the Open dialog box._

Open up Terminal and type
{{{
defaults write org.vim.MacVim AppleShowAllFiles 1
}}}
and restart !MacVim.


=== The keyboard layout switches on its own when I change mode ===

Add "set imd" to your "~/.vimrc" file (see ":h 'imd'" for more information).


=== The toolbar does not stay hidden when restarting !MacVim ===

Add "set go-=T" to "~/.gvimrc" (see ":h 'go'" for more information).


=== No window opens in !MacVim even when I select "New Window" from the "File" menu! ===

Update to snapshot 28 or later.


=== Backspace does not work ===

Update to snapshot 28 or later (or set the option 'backspace' to "indent,eol,start").
