#summary Link to latest snapshot with change log

= Regarding snapshots =

Snapshot builds of !MacVim are based on recent (hence untested) versions of the source code and are released fairly often.  Use these if you want access to the latest features and bug fixes but be aware that they may not behave as expected (which translates to _save often_).  That being said, if a snapshot has been released for a week or more that usually means that it is fairly stable (not to mention that I do all development using the latest snapshot).

= Download =

The latest version is [http://macvim.googlecode.com/files/MacVim-snapshot-34.tbz Snapshot 34] which was released Saturday the 16th of August 2006.  This link leads to an archive containing a universal binary that will run on Mac OS X 10.4 or later as well as the `mvim` script which can be placed anywhere in your path to allow you to easily start !MacVim from Terminal.  If the download fails, please try using the [http://newmacvim.muskokamug.org/ Downloads mirror].

Vim 7.2, file-open options, Quickstart, ...

This snapshot is based on the recently released Vim 7.2 and it contains
some new features and bug fixes.  Here's a partial list:

  * More options on how new files should open (in tabs/splits/etc.): Open the preferences to check this out.
  * Quickstart: With this feature enabled new windows open instantaneously (but _not_ if you use the 'mvim' script).  It is disabled by default so go to the Advanced preferences to enable it (and be sure to read the "disclaimer"...note that any changes to ~/.vim or its subdirectories are automatically detected on Leopard).
  * The ATSUI renderer has received a few bug fixes and it now includes mouse support (it can be enabled in the Advanced prefs).  (bug fixes by Jjgod Jiang)
  * Some of the old toolbar icons have been resurrected.
  * The current directory is handled more consistently: New windows always have the user's home directory set as current.  Opening a file in the Finder results in the current directory being set to the directory the file is in (unless the file opened in a window with other files already open).
  * Windows opened from the Dock menu are in focus.
  * Menu item to toggle the Plug-in drawer (Matt Tolton).
  * Now possible to set 'linespace' in [g]vimrc.
  * Help file cleanup (Michael Wookey).
  * Problems with ptys on Leopard fixed (Ben Schmidt).
  * (Hopefully) no more annoying "dropping incoming DO message ..." warnings.
  * Scroll wheel (track pad) should behave better with fast machines (Issue 100)
  * Various bug fixes...
