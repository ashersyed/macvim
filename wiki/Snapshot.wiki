Snapshot builds of !MacVim are based on recent (hence untested) versions of the source code and are released fairly often.  Use these if you want access to the latest features and bug fixes but be aware that they may not behave as expected (which translates to _save often_).  That being said, if a snapshot has been released for a week or more that usually means that it is fairly stable (not to mention that I do all development using the latest snapshot).

== Snapshot 36 ==

This snapshot fixes a problem with dropped characters that was introduced with snapshot 35.  Other changes since snapshot 35:

  * More help file updates
  * Fixed memory leak (Jonathon Mah)
  * Tool tips for truncated tab labels (Jonathon Mah)
  * Support drag and drop on tabs and on tabline (Jonathon Mah)
  * Modifier key can be used as control (useful for turning Caps Lock into Esc, see ":h macvim-esc")
  * Added "Find & Replace" dialog box (Cmd-f)



== Snapshot 35 ==

With this snapshot I have focused on making !MacVim faster, fixing bugs, and updating the documentation.  As a result !MacVim now feels snappier, flickers less, takes less time to startup from Terminal, and in some cases there are tremendous speed increases.

Here is a summary of the changes since snapshot 34:

  * Faster startup times
  * Overall faster drawing
  * Quicker response to key presses
  * Fix bug where key presses were ignored when mouse was moved simultaneously
  * Update ":h macvim" docs
  * Add mvim:// URL handler support (Nico Weber)
  * The !VimLeave autocommand works with :maca (see ":h macvim-hints")
  * Multiple files opened from Finder are sorted
  * Don't shift new windows downwards if they are vertically maximized
  * Add option to hide !MacVim when last window closes
  * The "Save changes" dialog conforms to the Apple HIG (works with Cmd-D)
  * Fix problems with 'fullscreen' and :mksession (Nico Weber)
  * Cmd-e copies selection to Find Pasteboard without searching
  * Fix bug with blurry text in full-screen with ATSUI (Jjgod Jiang)
  * Cmd-. can be used to interrupt Vim (and to exit insert mode)
  * Add "New Document Here" system service (Ron Olson)
  * Simplify system services menu (honors the "Open files..." pref)
  * Full-screen background color is updated immediately when 'fuopt' changes
  * Cursor no longer escapes the command line on Cmd-=/Cmd--
  * Add Input Manager support to ATSUI renderer (Kaoru Yoshida)
  * Use latest Vim source code and runtime files
  * Minor bug fixes


== Snapshot 34 ==

This snapshot is based on the recently released Vim 7.2 and it contains
some new features and bug fixes.  Here's a partial list:

  * More options on how new files should open (in tabs/splits/etc.): Open the preferences to check this out.
  * Quickstart: With this feature enabled new windows open instantaneously (but _not_ if you use the 'mvim' script).  It is disabled by default so go to the Advanced preferences to enable it (and be sure to read the "disclaimer"...note that any changes to ~/.vim or its subdirectories are automatically detected on Leopard).
  * The ATSUI renderer has received a few bug fixes and it now includes mouse support (it can be enabled in the Advanced prefs).  (bug fixes by Jjgod Jiang)
  * Some of the old toolbar icons have been resurrected.
  * The current directory is handled more consistently: New windows always have the user's home directory set as current.  Opening a file in the Finder results in the current directory being set to the directory the file is in (unless the file opened in a window with other files already open).
  * Windows opened from the Dock menu are in focus.
  * Menu item to toggle the Plug-in drawer (Matt Tolton).
  * Now possible to set 'linespace' in [g]vimrc.
  * Help file cleanup (Michael Wookey).
  * Problems with ptys on Leopard fixed (Ben Schmidt).
  * (Hopefully) no more annoying "dropping incoming DO message ..." warnings.
  * Scroll wheel (track pad) should behave better with fast machines (Issue 100)
  * Various bug fixes...
